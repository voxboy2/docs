title: Piggyvest Webhook
---

When integrating Piggyvest API, your system should be able to receive events happening in your Piggyvest accounts. To do that, you can add a Webhook URL on your dashboard so that your system or application can use the notification received to update a record, perform an action on your application, etc.

To enable webhook events, you should register the webhook endpoint where you want to receive notifications. After adding your webhook URL, Piggyvest can push real-time event data to your webhook endpoint when events happen in your Piggyvest account.

- A webhook URL is an endpoint on your server that can receive API requests from Piggyvest. It’s important to note that these requests come as HTTP POST requests.
- Piggyvest uses HTTPS to send webhook events to your application as a JSON payload with an Event object.

**Create the Webhook Url**

A webhook URL is a post endpoint that receives notifications from a server. The URL needs to parse a JSON request and return a 200 OK:

Add Your Webhook Url

```webhook_url.js
app.post("/my/webhook/url", function(req, res) {
    // Retrieve the request's body
    const event = req.body;
    // Do something with event
    res.send(200);
});
```

Add Your Webhook URL

You can specify your webhook URL in the API and webhook page tab of your dashboard. Make sure that the webhook URL is unauthenticated and publicly available.

**Verify event origin**

It’s important to note that your webhook URL is publicly available to anyone or system globally. To safeguard against potential misuse or exploitation of your webhook URL, you should verify your webhooks.

There are two ways to ensure events to your webhook URL are from Piggyvest :

- Signature validation
- IP whitelisting

**​Signature validation**

Before processing the webhook received from PiggyVest, the merchant should verify the HMAC SHA512 signature in the ‘x-pvb-signature’ header by comparing it with the received signature; proceeding only if the signatures match to ensure the integrity of the event payload and prevent unauthorized access


```webhook-validation.json
import crypto from 'crypto'

const secretKey = process.env.PVB_SECRET_KEY

router.post('/my-webhook-url', function (request, response) {
	const hash = crypto
    .createHmac('sha512', secret)
    .update(JSON.stringify(request.body))
    .digest('hex')

if (hash !== request.headers['x-pvb-signature'] {
      // Invalid signature return early
      return response.sendStatus(200);
 }

// Validated, Do your thing here
  response.sendStatus(200);
})
```
