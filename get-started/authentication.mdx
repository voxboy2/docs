## Understanding API Key Types

Two API keys are available on your dashboard: the Secret Key and the Public key.

1. Secret Key: This key is used for making API requests and should be treated with utmost confidentiality, as it grants unrestricted access to perform API requests to your Piggyvest business account. It allows actions like transfers, creating wallets, and more.

```json
-H "PVB_SECRET_KEY: your_secret_key"
```

2. Public Key: This key identifies your business with Piggyvest and can be used in plugins, libraries, front-end apps, or mobile apps.
