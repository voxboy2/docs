title: Create a customer
---

Currently, customers can only be created via an API, in the sample below we create a customer by calling the create customer endpoint.

**Body Parameters**
| Parameters | Description | Mandatory |
| --- | --- | --- |
| email| Email of the customer. Must be Unique to your account. | Required |
| name| Full name of the customer | Required |
| phone | The customer’s phone number must be unique within your account or integration | Required |
| bvn | Bvn information of the customer. | Required |
| id_type | Government issued identity type for the customer. possible values are `international_passport`, `nin`, `voter_card` and `driver_license`. | Required |
| id_number | Number for the `id_type` provided. | Required |
| third_party_identifier | The unique identifier for the customer on your platform. Ideally, this should be a value that distinctly identifies the user within your system, such as a user ID or email etc |  **optional** |

<Note>Upon calling this endpoint, both the customer and a default wallet are created. No webhook is sent for this initial action, so a `200 OK response` confirms that both the customer and wallet have been successfully created.</Note>
<Note>The only webhook we send during the customer creation process is `reserve_virtual_account.success`, which is triggered when a virtual account is created for the customer’s default wallet, used for funding purposes.</Note>
<Note>If you need to create additional wallets linked to the same customer, you can call the Create Wallet endpoint and pass the customer ID.</Note>

```tsx Request
import axios from 'axios'

const secretKey = process.env.PVB_SECRET_KEY
const url = ${process.env.PVB_BASE_URL}/api/v1/customers

const payload = {
    email: "myuser@gmail.com",
    name: "John champion",
    phone: "08122299933",
    bvn: "22112200222",
    id_type: "nin",
    id_number: "09123490456",
    third_party_identifier: "71521345-802f-4934-82bb-e0c8f8ff1e9d"
}

await axios.post(url, payload, {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${secretKey}`,
    },
  })
```

Sample success response below

```tsx Success
