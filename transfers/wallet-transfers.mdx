A request would look like this

```tsx request
import axios from 'axios'

const secretKey = process.env.PVB_SECRET_KEY
const url = ${process.env.PVB_BASE_URL}/api/v1/transfer/wallet
const payload = {
    amount: 500000,
    narration: "Transfer to user 2",
    currency: "NGN",
    source: "f3ad0937-1d03-4843-b3d3-a09210967e49",
    destination: "023f843a-be7e-494a-bc5d-9f49f4cc640f",
    reference: "7bc2dfe9-fad4-48d7-af45-87b55baca2e9"
}

await axios.post(url, payload, {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${secretKey}`,
    },
 })
```


<Note>
  Please note that a 200 successful response is an indication that the request
  has been scheduled to process successfully, This is not the final confirmation
  of the transaction status. For final confirmation either wait for webhooks or
  have a re-query strategy to do TSQ at intervals till the transaction status is
  "successful" or "failed"
</Note>

A response would look like this

```tsx Processing
{
    "status": true,
    "message": "Peer to Peer Wallet transfer processing"
}
```

<CodeGroup>

```tsx Insufficient Funds Error
{
  "status": false,
  "message": "Insufficient funds"
}
```

```tsx Error during processing
{
  "status": false,
  "message": "An error occurred processing wallet transfer"
}
```

</CodeGroup>

</Step>

<Step title="Verify payment">
It's crucial to verify the transaction by using your reference.
 Even though the webhook was visited it doesn't guarantee the transaction's success.
 In case the webhook notification fails to reach your server, confirming the payout through the verify payment endpoint is necessary.

</Step>
