    amount: 500000,
    narration: "Transfer to user 2",
    currency: "NGN",
    source: "f3ad0937-1d03-4843-b3d3-a09210967e49",

await axios.post(url, payload, {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${secretKey}`,

```

<Note>
  Please note that a 200 successful response is an indication that the request

## Receiving and Validating webhooks
We will send a webhook notification when a wallet transfer is successful or fails. To ensure security, please verify that the webhook originates from our system by checking the provided signature header. 
If the webhook does not successfully reach your server, please confirm the wallet transfer status using the verified payment endpoint.
