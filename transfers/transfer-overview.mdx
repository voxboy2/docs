```tsx verify account number
  "bankCode": "3859082",
  "accountNumber": "1501762893"
```
​
### Request payout
Make an API call to the transfer endpoint with the required parameters below.

| narration| The description of what the transfer is for| Required |
| currency | The currency which is used to fund the transfer| Required |

The payload should look like this

```tsx transfer
import axios from 'axios'

const secretKey = process.env.PVB_SECRET_KEY
const url = ${process.env.PVB_BASE_URL}/api/v1/transfer/bank
const payload = {
    amount: 500000,
    narration: "Transfer to user 2",
    currency: "NGN",
    source: "f3ad0937-1d03-4843-b3d3-a09210967e49",
    accountNumber: "0743399098",
    bankCode: "3164567",
    reference: "7bc2dfe9-fad4-48d7-af45-87b55baca2e9"
}

await axios.post(url, payload, {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${secretKey}`,
    },
  })
```

The response should look like the below 

<CodeGroup>

```tsx Transaction processing
{
    "status": true,
    "message": "Bank transfer is processing"
}
```

```tsx Insufficient funds(400 status code)
{
  "status": false,
  "message": "Insufficient funds"
}
```

```tsx Transfer error
{
  "status": false,
  "message": "An error occurred processing bank transfer"
}
```
</CodeGroup>


NOTE: Please note that a 200 successful response is an indication that the request
has been scheduled to process successfully, This is not the final confirmation of
the transaction status. For final confirmation either wait for webhooks or have a re-query
strategy to do TSQ at intervals till the transaction status is "successful" or 
"failed"
​
### Receive and validate webhook notification
Listen for webhook events. We will send a notification to your webhook URL that indicates the transfer status. Read our guide on securing and validating the webhook notification on your end.

}
```
### Verify payment
It’s crucial to verify the transaction by using your reference. Even though the webhook was visited it doesn’t guarantee the transaction’s success. In case the webhook notification fails to reach your server, confirming the payout through the verify payment endpoint is necessary.
