| payout_type      | Possible values for payout type is either **recurring** or **one-time**, If set to “one-time” then we would only attempt transfer ONCE on the start_date, if “recurring” then the next charge attempt will be based on the frequency set.                                                                                                                                              | Required  |

| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| is_active           | To Cancel a payment pass value as boolean false. To reactivate pass boolean true                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Required  |
| next_charge_attempt | Format YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss. You can optionally pass this when re-activating a payment ”is_active: true”.This MUST not be a date in the past. If you pass this value we will use this to schedule the next transfer attempt. And then future subsequent payments after that will be based on the schedule payment frequency. If this value is not passed we will use the current “next_charge_attempt” of the payment to schedule the next transfer attempt. If this value is a date in the past then we will start the charge from current time and subsequently derive next charge attempt from the scheduled payment frequency. So to have more control over the next charge attempt on reactivating a payment its best to pass this value. OPTIONAL | OPTIONAL  |

<Note>
  If a payment has an end_date and the end date has passed, You will not be able
  to reactivate.
</Note>

A request should be like the below

```tsx Request
import axios from 'axios'

const secretKey = process.env.PVB_SECRET_KEY
const url = ${process.env.PVB_BASE_URL}/api/v1/transfer/schedule-payment/:schedule_payment_id
const payload = {
    is_active: false, // Pass true to re-activate
}

await axios.patch(url, payload, {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${secretKey}`,
    },
  })
```
