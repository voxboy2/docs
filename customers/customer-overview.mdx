A customer is any end user with an account on your platform. To establish a presence for your customers on our platform, simply create their accounts using our Customer API.
<Note>A customer can represent either an individual or a business, depending on your platform's requirements.</Note>
Upon creating a customer, a default wallet is automatically generated for them. Additional wallets can be created later if needed. You have two options: either create individual customers, each with a unique wallet or create a single customer with multiple wallets.
