title:  Customer Overview 
---
A customer is a user with an account on our platform, engaging with our products. To establish a presence on our platform, customers need to be created, and Piggyvest enables the creation of an unlimited number of customers through the [customer API](/api-reference/customer/customer).

On creation of a customer, a default wallet is created for the customer then additional wallets can be created afterward. Customers can be created individually, each having a unique wallet, or a single customer can be created with the option to generate multiple wallets for that specific customer.
