## How To Accept Payment using checkouts

To implement paywithPocket in an organized way, here’s a sample guide covering the basic steps.
This will include setup, initializing the SDK, handling the payment process, and managing callbacks for various transaction states.

<Steps>

<Step title="Include the paywithPocket SDK">
  Add the following script to your HTML file where you want to use paywithPocket
  ```HTML index
  <script src="https://pocket-checkout-sdk.netlify.app/checkout-sdk.js"></script>
  ```
</Step>

<Step title = "Initialize the SDK on Your Web Page">
You can initialize Pay with Pocket in your JavaScript with the provided parameters.

Here's a basic structure for initialization, setting options, and handling responses:

```JavaScript
// Initialize Pay with Pocket with required parameters
const payWithPocket = new Pocket({
  key: 'YOUR_MERCHANT_PUBLIC_KEY',   // Public key from your merchant account
  amount: 2500000,                   // Transaction amount in kobo (e.g., 2500000 = ₦25,000)
  wallet_id: 'TARGET_WALLET_ID',     // Optional: specify target wallet
  reference: 'YOUR_TRANSACTION_REF', // Unique reference for each transaction
  product_name: 'Product Name',      // Optional: Product or service name
  narration: 'Transaction Description', // Brief description of the transaction
  view: "popup",                     // "popup" for modal or "redirect" for new tab
  redirect_url: "https://example.com/success", // URL to redirect on success
  onSuccess: (reference) => {
    console.log("Transaction Successful:", reference);
    alert(`Payment successful! Reference: ${reference}`);
  },
  onClose: () => {
    console.log("Checkout closed by the user.");
    alert("Payment process was closed.");
  },
  onPending: () => {
    console.log("Payment is pending confirmation.");
  },
  onOpen: () => {
    console.log("Payment checkout has been opened.");
  },
  onError: (error) => {
    console.error("An error occurred:", error);
    alert("An error occurred during the payment process.");
  }
});
```

</Step>

<Step title = "Trigger the Checkout UI">
You can directly call .show() to display the checkout UI or bind it to a specific button. Here’s how to set up both options:

Option 1: Direct Call

```jsx
// Display the checkout UI immediately
payWithPocket.show();
```

Option 2: Bind to a Button Click

```HTML
<!-- HTML button to trigger the payment -->
<button id="payWithPocketButton">Pay with Pocket</button>
```

```jsx
// Trigger the checkout when button is clicked
document.getElementById("payWithPocketButton").addEventListener("click", () => {
  payWithPocket.show();
});
```

</Step>

<Step title = "Update Payment Status (Optional)">
After payment confirmation, you may want to manually update the payment status if any backend events or webhooks influence it.

```jsx
// Update status manually (e.g., from a webhook or external confirmation)
payWithPocket.updatePaymentStatus("success"); // or 'failed'
```

</Step>

<Step title = "Receive and validate webhook notification">

To capture payment events like success, failure, or pending, set up a backend endpoint to receive webhooks from the Pay with Pocket platform. Read our guide on securing and validating the [webhook notification](/get-started/webhooks) on your end.

Here’s a sample JSON structure of the webhook data:

```json
{
  "eventId": "01J9X83PAG228MPS6WDTJFGK8D",
  "customer_id": "55b71d43-2efa-4ad8-ab67-2addabaee1ad",
  "eventType": "pocket-transfer.inflow.success",
  "eventCategory": "inflow_transaction",
  "eventData": {
    "id": "831bbab0-87a2-11ef-adac-42010a9c0fc0",
    "customer_id": "55b71d23-2efa-4ad8-ab67-2addabaee1ad",
    "destination_wallet_id": "083fa052-24d2-48f8-a954-5c79b50399ec",
    "type": "inter",
    "category": "pocket_transfer_inflow",
    "amount": 50000,
    "currency": "NGN",
    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "timestamp": "2024-10-11T07:36:22.079Z"
  }
}
```
</Step>

</Steps>
