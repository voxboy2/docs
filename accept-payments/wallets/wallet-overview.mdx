## Interest Management
Earn 11% annual interest on your wallet balance. Interest is accrued daily and paid monthly on the first day of each month. 
To ensure you receive interest on the first day of the month, you can try limiting transfers out of your wallet to four times per month.

<Warning>If there are four or more transfers out of the wallet in a month, the wallet will not earn interest for that month.</Warning>

Configure the interests rates of your wallets and select where the balance should go
