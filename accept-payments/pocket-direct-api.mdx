title: Pocket Direct API
---

The Pocket Direct API feature makes it easy for you to collect payments from your customers by directly debiting their pocket account
through a single integration—without using the Pay with Pocket checkout method. This API allows you to implement your own user interface, branding, and customer
flow, while retaining the full functionality of the Pay with Pocket checkout.

## How It Works

<Steps>
<Step title = "Collect customer's payment details.">
Step 1 - Collect customer's payment details. 
This includes the customers tag, the amount of the servive or product that you want to charge them for, narration this is description of what the paymnent is for , reference ,
a unique reference generated on your platform for the transaction, product_name .  
</Step>

<Step title = "Make a request to the pocket direct API">
Make a request to the  pocket direct API endpoint consisting of the customer details as well as the wallet represented by wallet_id  that you want to receive your payments in.

```tsx Request
{
    "tag": "mazigraphql", // Required
    "amount": 20000, // Required, Kobo
    "narration": "Success test", // Required
    "reference": "101029928283737373636533", // Required

}
```

```tsx Response
{
    "status": true,
    "data": {
        "response_code": "00",
        "account_number": "0816973685",
        "account_name": "Efe Ebieroma",
        "bank_code": "058",
        "response_message": "Payment initiated",
        "currency": "NGN"
    }
}
```

</Step>

<Step title = "Customer choses to accept or decline the payment">
A notification will appear on the customer’s Pocket app, where they can choose to accept or decline the payment request:

- If accepted: The customer’s account will be debited, and the payment will be processed.
