title: Transfer to banks
---

This section explains the parameters that are needed to send money to a bank account. The process for bank account transfers involves initiating a POST request through our Transfer API.

## Step by step process on how to make a bank transfer 
The following steps need to be taken in order to process payments to a bank account:

## 1. Verify the account number: 
The account number of the recipient should be verified using the resolve account API. 


<CodeGroup>

```json verify-account.json
  "bankCode": "3859082",
  "accountNumber": "1501762893"
}'
```


```json response.json
{
  "status": true,
  "message": "Name Enquiry fetched successfully",
  "data": {
    "accountName": "john doe",
    "accountNumber": "150170985433",
    "bankCode": "058",
    "sessionId": "jvuHte111323083556PMCargasxascas"
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## 2. Request payout: 
Make an API call to the payout endpoint with the required parameters below.

}'
```

## 3. Receive and validate webhook notification

Listen for webhook events. We will send a notification to your webhook URL that indicates the transfer status. Read our guide on securing and validating the webhook notification on your end. 
Please check the payout webhook page for further details on the different types webhook structures and body

    },
    eventType: "bank-transfer.outflow.success",
    eventCategory: "bank_transfer"
}
```

```json crypto.json
import crypto from "crypto";

const encryptedData =  crypto
      .createHmac("SHA512", merchantWebhookSecretKey)
      .update(JSON.stringify(payload)) 
      .digest("hex");
const signatureFromWebhook = req.headers['signature'];

if(encryptedData === signatureFromWebhook) {
  console.log("process");
}
else {
  console.log("discard");
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## 5 - Verify payment
It's crucial to verify the transaction by using your reference. Even though the webhook was visited it doesn't guarantee the transaction's success. In case the webhook notification fails to reach your server, confirming the payout through the verify payment endpoint is necessary.
